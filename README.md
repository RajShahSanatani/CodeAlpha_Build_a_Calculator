# CodeAlpha_Build_a_Calculator
As part of my frontend development internship at CodeAlpha, I built a modern calculator web app using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project supports:  ✅ Basic arithmetic operations (+, −, ×, ÷) ✅ Real-time input and result display ✅ Dark mode theme with glowing UI ✅ Keyboard input support ✅ Calculation history tracking
